		<p>At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland&mdash;no fire at all&mdash;the landlord said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind&mdash;not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.</p>

<p>"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty."</p>

<p>"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don't&mdash;he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."</p>

<p>"The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?"</p>

		<p>The council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum, while below them stood the prisoner and her two guards.  I saw that one of the women was Sarkoja, and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing of the preceding day, the results of which she had reported to the occupants of our dormitory last night.  Her attitude toward the captive was most harsh and brutal.  When she held her, she sunk her rudimentary nails into the poor girl's flesh, or twisted her arm in a most painful manner.  When it was necessary to move from one spot to another she either jerked her roughly, or pushed her headlong before her.  She seemed to be venting upon this poor defenseless creature all the hatred, cruelty, ferocity, and spite of her nine hundred years, backed by unguessable ages of fierce and brutal ancestors.</p>

<p>The other woman was less cruel because she was entirely indifferent; if the prisoner had been left to her alone, and fortunately she was at night, she would have received no harsh treatment, nor, by the same token would she have received any attention at all.</p>

<p>As Lorquas Ptomel raised his eyes to address the prisoner they fell on me and he turned to Tars Tarkas with a word, and gesture of impatience. Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch, but which caused Lorquas Ptomel to smile; after which they paid no further attention to me.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Lorquas Ptomel, addressing the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Dejah Thoris, daughter of Mors Kajak of Helium."</p></div>

		<p>"Yes, I'm thinking of it," I answered; "but what difference will it make when our air supply is exhausted whether the temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000?  We'll be just as dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow." But I must admit that for some unaccountable reason the stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.  What I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did I try.  The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain, of the blasting of several very exact and learned scientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not know what lay before us within the bowels of the earth, and so we might continue to hope for the best, at least until we were dead&mdash;when hope would no longer be essential to our happiness.  It was very good, and logical reasoning, and so I embraced it.</p>

<p>At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2 DEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.</p>

<p>From then on until noon of the second day, it continued to drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had been unbearably hot before. At the depth of two hundred and forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped to TEN BELOW ZERO!  We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees.  During the next three hours we passed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging into another series of ammonia-impregnated strata, where the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.</p>

<p>Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at last we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.  At four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.  Feverishly I watched the thermometer.  Slowly it rose.  Perry had ceased singing and was at last praying.</p>

<p>Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually increasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations much greater than it really was.  For another hour I saw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until at four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.  Now it was that we began to hang upon those readings in almost breathless anxiety.</p></div>

		<p>"Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!" came echoing down the road.</p>

<p>There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these came men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.</p>

<p>But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in common.  There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed activity.  The heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the various cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a refrain:</p>

<p>"Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!"</p>

<p>Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have friends.</p></div>
